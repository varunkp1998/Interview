This code implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using PySpark and SQLite to analyze sales data from two regions. It reads CSV files, transforms the data by adding calculated columns and filtering out negative sales, and then loads the cleaned data into a SQLite database. Finally, it runs SQL queries to validate the data integrity and summarize sales information.
